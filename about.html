      <p>Adam Melrose is a North Carolina attorney based out of Charlotte.</p>

        But enough of the awkward third-person corporate-speak (doing it for the
        SEO!). I'm a nerd that's obsessed with learning a little bit about
        everything. While litigating personal injury and real property lawsuits
        are my primary profession, I'm also a real estate investor with a
        triplex and a couple single family homes. I'm looking to invest in more
        multifamily homes, self-storage facilities, and laundromats.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm also obsessed with general personal finance. While I don't go to the
        depths of credit card churning like some of my friends, I do continue to
        maintain a serious interest in stable finances and diversification
        (hence the real estate holdings).
      </p>
      When I'm not working, I can usually be found working on my reef tank (I've
      even gone so far as to create and maintain a semi-successful aquarium
      website), or playing various card games and competitive video games with
      friends. I'm also interested in getting into YouTube and personal content
      creation. If there's some content where you think my contribution would be
      useful, please do not hesitate to contact me through this website.
